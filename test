what is cyber security,why we need cyber security
necessity of cyber security
requirments of cyber security 
responsibilities in cyber security
needs of (FORVES)  Cyber sercurity
^^check point security (company)(checking live cyber attacks)
^^Anti virus companies
Radware
types of hackers -- black hat,white hat,gray hat
Owasp top ten
(Deep and Dark web)
zero day vulnerability
^^palo alto company 
cyber thearts, Vulnerabilities
Common cyber security risks
CIA
Five phase of hacking (6.repoting)
^^VAPT REPORT
(information gatering-active,pasive
foot printing-active-direct intarcting,passive-
reconnaissance
osintframework)
Types of scanning
Phising--social engineering attacks(tricking attacks)
Malware-maliciuos
types of malware
**virus-spearding by our self
**worm-automattically attacks(worm spearding ai=utumat)
spy ware-install software by others in our pc hacking inforamation
trojan-view panna noraml ah irukum(oru software ah inoru software ah ulla hide panni veikarathu)(eg:cracked software)(trasfer to cnc (command and control))
bots-collections of 
**Ransomware-organization face risk(entire hard disk ah encyrpt pannitu show popup(pay pandra mari pop up kaatum)(Dangers attack)
**DDos attack--diff b/w dos and DDos---Dos attack----single person attack (downing a web site(sending traffics,etc..) )
DDOS ---multiple persons attacks
status code,****cyber shef for reversing code
insider threats-within a organization
DNS tunneling-
burte force attacks-- b//w dictnory attacks
Iot attacks
botnet attacks
Man in the middle attacks--in b/w client and server (clear traffic means prblm)
Backdoor attacks--maintaining access-persistance 
zero day--unpatched security vulnerability
step by step process---enumuration
techniques of enumuration
threat actors---illigal activities,bad actors,adversory
types of threat actors
phising 
######incident(something that affect CIA) response team -----NIST cyber security frame work ---steps for incident response team---incident response plan
->Identify(assesst identify)
->protect
->detect
->respond
->recover
4 steps NIST frame work
preparation phase
detection and analysis
containment eradication and recovery
post incident activity
core skill required in cyber security
access the risk--likly hood and impact
network
n/w security
n/w segmentation
ids and ips
intrusion--unauthorzied access
IDS-similar to antivirus (only prevent (taken action by ourself)
VPN-it creats a lan virutaly (privately)
proxy
wax-web application
WPA 2 is commanly used
wired ,wireless
firefall-filter the traffic or block(transport layer)
types of fire wall service
statefull---fairewall knows about packet(communicating b/w client and server)
stateless--it does not know about a package(not communication)
packet filtering
Email security
anti-malware---microsoft defender
antivirus--behaviour change
network segmentation
access control
application security
HIDS-host based intrustion detection system(
nids--n/w based intrusion detection system(filtering entire n/w)
types of mobile device management---MDM(all company have MDM)
end point prodection--antivirus(host)(device)
CASB
LOSS ARE STOLEN DEVICE PROJECT
zero trust n/w access
OSI MODEL
cryptography
***asymentric encryption****sysmentric encryption
***Crytography attacks
security control
->physical
->administative(policy ,procedure)
->logical or technical(paaswrd,user name,otp)
compliance---to flow a rule
need of compliance 
information security compliance
